            <div class="markdown">**About Us**\nNetflix is on a mission to entertain the world, serving 214+ million
              members in 190+ countries, bringing member joy and connecting them with compelling content.&nbsp; Our
              unique culture enables us to continually evolve and innovate on our business and technology, now reaching
              audiences and producing global content at a scale never done before.\n\nThe Netflix API team has been at
              the forefront of this technical innovation, building multiple generations of API stacks, creating a
              unified abstraction and composite model over disparate Netflix mid-tier systems, enabling device teams to
              build innovative user experiences throughout our streaming history. The team also ensures the resiliency
              and scalability of this critical API tier, which must be functional and available for the Netflix
              experience to work.&nbsp; &nbsp;Ultimately, the team provides leverage for product innovation, including
              our recent foray into Games.\n\n**The Opportunity**\nAs a member of this team, you will help maintain a
              complex, high-scale, tier-1 API ‚Äúmonolith‚Äù that powers multi-generational API Experiences at Netflix; from
              our original REST API and Partner Catalog Feeds to API.NEXT, a serverless platform tapping into a myriad
              of Java libraries, to Falcor, a Netflix invented Graph language to Consumer Edge, a federated GraphQL API
              that powers a new set of device to server APIs at Netflix.&nbsp; &nbsp;You‚Äôll also help innovate on high
              leverage systems such as a unified proto-based ‚ÄúData API‚Äù making our API stacks more manageable and
              extensible, a context sharing mechanism for federated GraphQL services or a session service to help other
              teams scale better.\n\n**What you can expect**\n\n**1 month&nbsp;**\nYou will spend time getting familiar
              with Netflix culture, the team, technology and terminology, meeting with partners and learning about your
              partner teams and what they do. This will help you build the picture of how your work directly impacts
              Netflix. You will commit something into production.\n\n**3 months**\nYou will get great at building,
              operating, evolving and maintaining critical microservices in distributed systems that are reliable and
              performant that are extremely easy to operate at scale. You will work across all phases of the software
              development lifecycle to design high-scale fault tolerant distributed systems. You will contribute to the
              quarterly roadmap (built by engineers) and retrospectives and take on-call rotation responsibilities. You
              will use your adaptability and remote-inclusive skills to enjoy learning and growing with your team and
              partners.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n**6 months**\nYou will lean into risk to innovate rapidly to scale and support
              the delivery of new, highly impactful features for key user experiences, design meaningful and intuitive
              APIs, and flexible and scalable data models. You will start contributing to the long-term roadmap for the
              team and the org.\n\n**12 months**\nYou will use your knowledge and creativity to champion and lead new
              initiatives and improvements for the team, group and org.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n \n\n#Salary and compensation\nNo
              salary data published by company so we estimated salary based on previous jobs related to Developer, API

              focus:**&nbsp;We're building Whimsical for the long-haul, not a quick exit. We avoid shortcuts and
              consider every key decision from a 10+ year perspective. \n\n-&nbsp;**Partnership Mindset:**&nbsp;We‚Äôve

      is building the fastest way to get a database, query data, and share data \u2014 publicly or privately. Despite
      the assertion that \u201cdata has become the new oil,\u201d the tooling around databases has not meaningfully
      changed in twenty years. Even with the push for big data and machine learning, a frustrated, growing cadre of data
      scientists and engineers have to spend too much time setting up and maintaining a basic set up just to use data.
      bit.io allows users to become immediately productive with data, reducing time from data upload to query to 1
      minute. And, our users love it, saying \u201cYour product is amazing\u201d, \u201creally love your product, maybe
      the best on the market\u201d, and \u201cI am sold on bit.io\u201d.\nbit.io\u2019s long term vision is to become
      the place for all the world\u2019s data, private and public, just like github is the place for source code.
      We\u2019re building a team of passionate dataphiles to make that vision a reality and make data - especially
      public data - more accessible to everyone. We\u2019ve got a ton of thorny database, infrastructure, UI, and UX
      problems to solve along the way. Come build it with us.\nCritical toward achieving bit.io\u2019s vision is a
      datastore that (1) scales to petabyte queries while still enabling fast query-iteration by users, and (2) applies
      data best practices while remaining flexible when opinionated defaults aren\u2019t enough. You will build
      bit.io\u2019s datastore.\n##As a Software Engineer at bit.io you will:\n* Work across the stack on all aspects of
      software engineering for the core product\n* Collaborate directly with all teammates on a small, productive
      technology team\n* Solve petabyte-scale problems in the data space\n* Design, build, test and deploy a complex
      data management system\n* Make broad, impactful technology decisions with responsibility for their
      outcomes\n##We\u2019re looking for someone who has:\n* Shipped product\n* Experience and passion in data, data
      engineering, and data processing\n* Deep knowledge in data management - parsing, cleaning, querying, extracting,
      etc.\n* A strong drive to make software easy-to-use\n##The ideal backend engineering candidate will have:\n*
      Expertise in Python and SQL\n* Constructed APIs with technology like REST, OpenAPI, or gRPC\n* Developed with
      microservices and container technologies like Docker & Kubernetes\n* High proficiency in building data processing
      pipelines, working with structured data, and leveraging common database technologies\nbit.io is an early-stage,
      well-funded startup that\u2019s fully remote. We\u2019re outcome-oriented, scientific, curious, respectful,
      resilient, and inclusive. In addition to competitive salary, equity, bonus, and benefits (including top-tier
      insurance, generous new-parent leave, and unlimited PTO), we do two unique things: (1) in order to be inclusive
      and to counter systemic hiring inequities, salary and equity is transparent and not negotiated \u2014 every
      employee with the same role and level is paid exactly the same; and, (2) we have 4-day x 8-hour work weeks (i.e.,
      no Fridays) \u2014 we value work-life balance and think you\u2019re just as productive. If you\u2019d like to
      learn more about what we\u2019re building, how we work, and how your career would develop with us, please reach
      out to careers@bit.io.\n###Additional Information Links:\n[How Our Early-Stage Startup is Offering Fair Equal and

              us.\nCritical toward achieving bit.io‚Äôs vision is a datastore that (1) scales to petabyte queries while
              still enabling fast query-iteration by users, and (2) applies data best practices while remaining flexible

              bit.io you will:\n* Work across the stack on all aspects of software engineering for the core product\n*
              Collaborate directly with all teammates on a small, productive technology team\n* Solve petabyte-scale
              problems in the data space\n* Design, build, test and deploy a complex data management system\n* Make
              broad, impactful technology decisions with responsibility for their outcomes\n##We‚Äôre looking for someone
              who has:\n* Shipped product\n* Experience and passion in data, data engineering, and data processing\n*
              Deep knowledge in data management - parsing, cleaning, querying, extracting, etc.\n* A strong drive to
              make software easy-to-use\n##The ideal backend engineering candidate will have:\n* Expertise in Python and
              SQL\n* Constructed APIs with technology like REST, OpenAPI, or gRPC\n* Developed with microservices and
              container technologies like Docker &amp; Kubernetes\n* High proficiency in building data processing
              pipelines, working with structured data, and leveraging common database technologies\nbit.io is an
              early-stage, well-funded startup that‚Äôs fully remote. We‚Äôre outcome-oriented, scientific, curious,
              respectful, resilient, and inclusive. In addition to competitive salary, equity, bonus, and benefits
              (including top-tier insurance, generous new-parent leave, and unlimited PTO), we do two unique things: (1)
              in order to be inclusive and to counter systemic hiring inequities, salary and equity is transparent and
              not negotiated ‚Äî every employee with the same role and level is paid exactly the same; and, (2) we have
              4-day x 8-hour work weeks (i.e., no Fridays) ‚Äî we value work-life balance and think you‚Äôre just as

You\u2019re working from home today, so you pay the pet tax and encourage your four-legged-friend wave to the camera before logging off.\n\nFirst up you\u2019ve got a pair-programming session with a Junior Developer in your team to help them through a tough search component that they\u2019ve been working on. They\u2019ve been steadily improving under your experienced wing and are turning into a really productive team member.\n\nAfter lunch you\u2019ll set your Slack status and turn on Do Not Disturb for a couple of hours while you debug a weird issue with a customer\u2019s site. There\u2019s been a change to the out of stock logic recently to support multiple warehouses. You update your unit test suite to cover this unexpected scenario and tell the Project Manager the good news! You push your feature branch to Bitbucket and watch Bitbucket Pipelines build your artifact and prove that your tests pass.\n\nYour JIRA issue has automatically transitioned to \u201cIn Code Review\u201d and you open your pull request, studying your diff carefully before assigning it to your team mate for a sanity check.\n\nTomorrow (assuming all is well!) you\u2019ll merge your pull request into a release branch and let Pipelines deploy it to Staging where it will be regression tested by the QA Team and their bank of automated tests. It should be out to Production by the end of the week, providing we can get through the testing and get client sign off by 2pm on Thursday.\n\n**If you read this and it sounds like your ideal job \u2014 we want you on the team!**\n\n### What you'll be doing\n\nThe following should give you an idea of how you\u2019ll be expected to typically be spending your time. It\u2019s not set in stone and it may change from week-to-week, but it gives an idea of what is expected from the role.\n\n#### Software Development (80%)\n\nThe majority of your time will be spent working with your team to deliver software that meets the needs of our customers. This isn\u2019t time that you\u2019ll spend entirely in your editor, there\u2019s stand up, sprint planning, scoping, architecting and designing that you\u2019ll take part in to make sure we\u2019re building exactly what we need in the right way.\n\nGiven your experience, a portion of this time is expected to be spent assisting other team members in delivering their work effectively.\n\n#### Process and Tooling Improvements (10%)\n\nMaking sure that we don\u2019t sit still and keep evolving the way we build and deliver software is a critical investment of time, particularly from a team member with your experience. Use this time to try that tool you read about and see if it\u2019s worthy of being a part of our toolchain.\n\n#### Personal Development (10%)\n\nKeeping up with new software releases, development practices, horror stories and post mortems are an essential part of any Software Developer\u2019s time! Use this time to push forward your objectives and research tools and techniques you need to stay productive.\n\n Apply now and work remotely at Space 48",	"baseSalary": {	"@type": "MonetaryAmount",	"currency": "USD",	"value": {	"@type": "QuantitativeValue",	"value": 80000,	"unitText": "ANN"	}	},"employmentType":"FULL_TIME","industry":"Startups","jobLocationType":"TELECOMMUTE","jobLocation":{"address":{"@type":"PostalAddress","addressCountry":"Anywhere","addressRegion":"Anywhere","streetAddress":"Anywhere","postalCode":"Anywhere","addressLocality":"Anywhere"}},"title":"Senior React Engineer","image":"https:\/\/remoteok.com\/assets\/img\/jobs\/b0df681abdff609323da1e6b83ddccc41635788017.png","occupationalCategory":"","workHours":"Flexible","validThrough":"2021-12-02T17:33:37+00:00","hiringOrganization":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Space 48","sameAs":null,"logo":"https:\/\/remoteok.com\/assets\/img\/jobs\/b0df681abdff609323da1e6b83ddccc41635788017.png"}}</script>

              applications to support our SaaS eCommerce and headless platforms.\n\nAs an example of what you'll be
              working on: we're building&nbsp;**headless eCommerce sites with Gatsby**&nbsp;and rich&nbsp;**interactive
              product customisers with Next.js on Vercel**.\n\nYou start your day in a team Stand Up discussing progress
              you made yesterday, listening to your team members describe their current issues and dropping some
              knowledge bombs on how you ‚Äúsolved this last time‚Äù. You‚Äôre working from home today, so you pay the pet tax
              and encourage your four-legged-friend wave to the camera before logging off.\n\nFirst up you‚Äôve got a
              pair-programming session with a Junior Developer in your team to help them through a tough search
              component that they‚Äôve been working on. They‚Äôve been steadily improving under your experienced wing and
              are turning into a really productive team member.\n\nAfter lunch you‚Äôll set your Slack status and turn on
              Do Not Disturb for a couple of hours while you debug a weird issue with a customer‚Äôs site. There‚Äôs been a
              change to the out of stock logic recently to support multiple warehouses. You update your unit test suite
              to cover this unexpected scenario and tell the Project Manager the good news! You push your feature branch
              to Bitbucket and watch Bitbucket Pipelines build your artifact and prove that your tests pass.\n\nYour
              JIRA issue has automatically transitioned to ‚ÄúIn Code Review‚Äù and you open your pull request, studying
              your diff carefully before assigning it to your team mate for a sanity check.\n\nTomorrow (assuming all is
              well!) you‚Äôll merge your pull request into a release branch and let Pipelines deploy it to Staging where
              it will be regression tested by the QA Team and their bank of automated tests. It should be out to
              Production by the end of the week, providing we can get through the testing and get client sign off by 2pm
              on Thursday.\n\n**If you read this and it sounds like your ideal job ‚Äî we want you on the team!**\n\n###
              What you'll be doing\n\nThe following should give you an idea of how you‚Äôll be expected to typically be
              spending your time. It‚Äôs not set in stone and it may change from week-to-week, but it gives an idea of
              what is expected from the role.\n\n#### Software Development (80%)\n\nThe majority of your time will be
              spent working with your team to deliver software that meets the needs of our customers. This isn‚Äôt time
              that you‚Äôll spend entirely in your editor, there‚Äôs stand up, sprint planning, scoping, architecting and
              designing that you‚Äôll take part in to make sure we‚Äôre building exactly what we need in the right
              way.\n\nGiven your experience, a portion of this time is expected to be spent assisting other team members
              in delivering their work effectively.\n\n#### Process and Tooling Improvements (10%)\n\nMaking sure that
              we don‚Äôt sit still and keep evolving the way we build and deliver software is a critical investment of
              time, particularly from a team member with your experience. Use this time to try that tool you read about
              and see if it‚Äôs worthy of being a part of our toolchain.\n\n#### Personal Development (10%)\n\nKeeping up
              with new software releases, development practices, horror stories and post mortems are an essential part
              of any Software Developer‚Äôs time! Use this time to push forward your objectives and research tools and
              techniques you need to stay productive.\n \n\nBe sure to mention the words **PELICAN ABILITY HAMSTER**
              when applying to show you read the job post completely. This is a beta feature to avoid spam applicants.

              unique solutions for securing and trading digital assets. Qredo is headquartered in London, UK, with
              development offices in Sofia, Bulgaria. Qredo is a well-funded, VC backed start-up with a clear mission
              and unprecedented demand for our products. Qredo is the ideal company for hard-working, highly creative

              role for a highly experienced Rust engineer whose objective is to build the next generation of blockchain
              infrastructure. Qredo has a novel plan to build infrastructure that is fit for purpose in the modern
              financial system. Qredo‚Äôs novel solution will aim to facilitate high throughput transactions that are
              verified more efficiently by validators, than current schemes proposed within the blockchain ecosystem
              (these are not conventional proof of work/of stake schemas).\n\nThe Rust Engineer will focus on the
              security, stability, scalability, and flexibility of Qredo‚Äôs blockchain infrastructure. The engineer will
              need to apply concepts from computer science/cryptographic/mathematical research to the software they will
              be tasked with building. This may mean reading research papers and reading mathematics.\n\nIf chosen, you
              will work on our core codebase, contributing to product design decisions and getting involved in the
              day-to-day activities of a small but highly productive development team. This is the perfect role for a
              highly experienced engineer who enjoys adopting new technologies and who sets high standards for
              themselves and those around them. You will be a leading and influential member of our development
              team.\n\n**Responsibilities**\n\n* Build the next version of Qredo chain from the specification produced
              by the CTO and engineering manager.\n* Comprehend the current state of the Qredo chain.\n* Our current
              stack is a mixture of Go, C, Python and JavaScript.\n* Proactively contribute to product and system design
              and architecture\n* At your discretion get involved with other aspects of the works undertaken by the
              R&amp;D Department such as:\n* Customer integration\n* App Development\n* UI Design\n* Attending
              meetups\n* Recruiting other team members\n* Mentor junior staff members\n\n**Skills and Experience**\n\n*
              Highly experienced with Rust\n* Good teamwork and communication skills\n* Excellent conversational English
              skills\n* Experience with some of C/C++, WASM, Go, Kotlin, Java, Python\n* System architecture and design,
              unit testing\n* Familiarity with Docker, AWS, Linux\n* Computer Science Degree or relevant degree\n*
              Knowledge and interest in cryptocurrencies\n* Debugging, diagnosing and solving problems\n \n\nBe sure to

      a Senior Software Engineer (Risk Management), you&rsquo;ll be part of a team of engineers that builds out the
      retail brokerage business and supports our other business initiatives. We care about the speed and stability of
      our back-end systems as much as we care about the customer-facing applications we build. Our architecture is
      consistently evolving as our business grows and we face different technical challenges, but always with a focus on
      practicality and performance. \n\nYou'll help by maintaining and building on current systems as well as green
      field projects and troubleshooting issues as they arise. Our engineers work with a wide variety of tools including
      C++, Java, Javascript, and Ruby. In this role, you&rsquo;ll be expected to maintain, build out, and develop new
      mission critical services in Java using the Akka framework. Additionally, you&rsquo;ll have a chance to help
      mentor more junior engineers and help them achieve success.\n\nWhat you&rsquo;ll do:\n\n\n* Maintain production
      systems, specifically risk management and trade event systems\n\n* Apply your knowledge of Reg T, Portfolio
      Margin, and SPAN margining to an existing production codebase and work closely with the risk management team to

      Services\n\n* A long history of deploying and managing production systems built in Java\n\n* Experience with Akka

      T, Portfolio Margin, Span and theoretical option pricing)\n\n* The ability to learn quickly in areas in which you
      don't already have deep expertise\n\n* The ability to jump into a brand new framework or language and quickly
      become productive in it\n\n* 8+ years of professional experience working as a software engineer on a team,
      preferably with some experience as a technical lead or mentor\n\n* Experience with other languages, such as Ruby,
      Python, C++\n\n\n\n\n\nTeam Perks:\n\n\n* Sustainable work day\n\n* Daily catered lunch when working in the
      office\n\n* Full kitchen with snacks and beverages\n\n* Dog-friendly office\n\n* In-building gym\n\n* Common
      rooftop deck with seating areas, landscaping, grills, and yard games\n\n* CTA stop a block away, Shuttle to\/from

Today, mortgage lenders are stuck running their companies on software products built 20 years ago. These products are slow and unstable, and end up costing lenders millions of dollars in other otherwise preventable mistakes every year. LoanCrate solves those problems and more, helping lenders improve the home-buying experience for people all over the country.\n\nSince starting in January 2021, our remote team has closed a $4m seed round, grown to 9 people, and launched our first product. And since adopting LoanCrate in June, our customers have used LoanCrate to power ~$7.5b in new home loans. We're on track to achieve strong profitability by mid-2022 after doubling (or more) our team size in the meantime.\n\nOur team is a group of people excited to tackle the complexity of the home-lending industry. We care about collaboration, very open communication covering the good & the bad so that we learn from our decisions quickly, and ultimately having fun while we take on industry giants. You'll fit in well if you like diving deep quickly!\n\n## The opportunity\n\nOur dreams are big and we have much to build! We're looking for senior software engineers to help lead our team in powering the future of home buying in the US (which could entail managing a majority of US home loans every year \u2014 financial assets worth trillions of dollars).\n\nWe are excited to offer competitive salary and equity for this role.\n\n## What to expect\n\nAs an engineer at LoanCrate, you'll continue our team tradition by shipping code to production on your first day! Following that, within your first month, you'll dive into your first mission-critical project, such as...\n\n- \ud83d\ude48 Architecting, building, and launching v2 of our no-code platform that our customers use to digitize their ops workflows and save millions of dollars per year.\n- \ud83e\udd1d Integrating with 3rd-party providers of lending services APIs to generate documents\/disclosures, produce automated underwriting results, or prevent fraud.\n- \ud83c\udfd7 Architecting, building, and launching the next generation of our job processing infrastructure on AWS to make LoanCrate's back end more observable and reliable.\n\n## Tech stack\n\nNearly all of our code is written in TypeScript. We use React on the frontend, Node\/Express on the backend (running inside Docker), GraphQL\/Apollo on both sides, and Postgres as our database. We use AWS (ECS, RDS, ElastiCache, SNS, and more) and manage all of our infrastructure with Terraform.\n\nWe believe that high engineering velocity drives high product velocity (and, in turn, our success as a company \ud83d\ude04). Keeping this in mind, we've invested heavily in creating a great developer experience that enables engineers to ship fast. Some highlights of our stack:\n\n- \u2194\ufe0f &nbsp;**End-to-End Type Safety**&nbsp;- We generate TypeScript types from our Postgres and GraphQL schemas so that when we change our database schema we see type errors in any incompatible frontend React components.\n- \ud83c\udf0e &nbsp;**Full-Stack Code Sharing**&nbsp;- Our build tooling supports seamless sharing of TypeScript files between the client, server, and other packages in our mono-repo so that we never have to define functions or configuration values twice.\n- \ud83c\udfe0 &nbsp;**Reproducible Infrastructure**&nbsp;- We\u2019ve used Terraform to manage 100% of our infrastructure since day 1 and have configured our CI pipeline to automatically deploy temporary staging environments for every pull request. We use these per-PR environments to get feedback from teammates and test any infrastructure changes using infrastructure that's identical to production.\n- \ud83e\uddea &nbsp;**First Class Testing Utilities**&nbsp;- We have a comprehensive library of utilities that mock production-like data and feed automated end-to-end, integration, and performance tests. Our wide-ranging test suite allows us to move fast while maintaining nearly perfect uptime.\n\n## Preferred skills and background\n\n(It's okay not to have all of these things - these are just some skills we are excited about!) \n\n- \ud83d\udd12 A constant and keen eye for security risks \u2014 we store and display some of people's most sensitive personal data and need to keep it safe!\n- \ud83c\udfa8 A desire to be product-oriented, from thinking through the product implications of what you're building to contributing your unique ideas of how to improve the product.\n- \ud83c\udfd9\ufe0f Ability to develop readable, maintainable, and effective software architecture patterns that support use of our product by various enterprise customers (each with thousands of employees and their own methods for running their companies).\n- \ud83d\udc69\u200d\ud83c\udfeb\ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83c\udfeb Excitement to mentor less senior engineers in both hard and soft skills.\n- \ud83d\ude88 SRE-oriented mindset for developing infrastructure that's reliable, observable, and requires minimal toil to maintain.\n- \ud83c\udf29\ufe0f Experience scaling high-throughput distributed systems in the cloud. Bonus points if you're experienced with infrastructure-as-code solutions like Terraform or CloudFormation!\n- \ud83d\udd27 Ability to develop full-stack web app features from design through deployment.\n- \ud83d\udee2\ufe0f Experience designing and scaling complex relational DB schemas, as well as figuring out performant ways to store, retrieve, and update such data. Home loans have thousands of data fields \ud83d\ude43.\n\n Apply now and work remotely at LoanCrate",	"baseSalary": {	"@type": "MonetaryAmount",	"currency": "USD",	"value": {	"@type": "QuantitativeValue",	"value": 230000,	"unitText": "ANN"	}	},"employmentType":"FULL_TIME","industry":"Startups","jobLocationType":"TELECOMMUTE","jobLocation":{"address":{"@type":"PostalAddress","addressCountry":"Anywhere","addressRegion":"Anywhere","streetAddress":"Anywhere","postalCode":"Anywhere","addressLocality":"Anywhere"}},"title":"Software Engineer","image":"https:\/\/remoteok.com\/assets\/img\/jobs\/\/5cb61253dadbb8b58478c46e5b4a460f1632507677.png","occupationalCategory":"","workHours":"Flexible","validThrough":"2021-11-24T19:44:20+00:00","hiringOrganization":{"@type":"Organization","name":"LoanCrate","sameAs":null,"logo":"https:\/\/remoteok.com\/assets\/img\/jobs\/\/5cb61253dadbb8b58478c46e5b4a460f1632507677.png"}}</script>

              supports seamless sharing of TypeScript files between the client, server, and other packages in our
              mono-repo so that we never have to define functions or configuration values twice.\n- üè†
              &nbsp;**Reproducible Infrastructure**&nbsp;- We‚Äôve used Terraform to manage 100% of our infrastructure
              since day 1 and have configured our CI pipeline to automatically deploy temporary staging environments for
              every pull request. We use these per-PR environments to get feedback from teammates and test any
              infrastructure changes using infrastructure that's identical to production.\n- üß™ &nbsp;**First Class
              Testing Utilities**&nbsp;- We have a comprehensive library of utilities that mock production-like data and
              feed automated end-to-end, integration, and performance tests. Our wide-ranging test suite allows us to
              move fast while maintaining nearly perfect uptime.\n\n## Preferred skills and background\n\n(It's okay not
              to have all of these things - these are just some skills we are excited about!) \n\n- üîí A constant and
              keen eye for security risks ‚Äî we store and display some of people's most sensitive personal data and need
              to keep it safe!\n- üé® A desire to be product-oriented, from thinking through the product implications of
              what you're building to contributing your unique ideas of how to improve the product.\n- üèôÔ∏è Ability to
              develop readable, maintainable, and effective software architecture patterns that support use of our
              product by various enterprise customers (each with thousands of employees and their own methods for
              running their companies).\n- üë©‚Äçüè´üë®‚Äçüè´ Excitement to mentor less senior engineers in both hard and soft
              skills.\n- üöà SRE-oriented mindset for developing infrastructure that's reliable, observable, and requires
              minimal toil to maintain.\n- üå©Ô∏è Experience scaling high-throughput distributed systems in the cloud.
              Bonus points if you're experienced with infrastructure-as-code solutions like Terraform or
              CloudFormation!\n- üîß Ability to develop full-stack web app features from design through deployment.\n-
              üõ¢Ô∏è Experience designing and scaling complex relational DB schemas, as well as figuring out performant
              ways to store, retrieve, and update such data. Home loans have thousands of data fields üôÉ.\n \n\nBe sure
              to mention the words **OUTSIDE THANK AWAY** when applying to show you read the job post completely. This
              is a beta feature to avoid spam applicants. Companies can search these words to find applicants that read
              this and see they're human.\n\n \n\n#Salary and compensation\nNo salary data published by company so we

            <h1 style="text-align:left;">Coursedog is hiring a Remote Backend Node.js Engineer</h1>
            <div class="markdown">Higher Education is in crisis. The cost of education is skyrocketing, while only 33%
              of students in the US graduate in four years and issues of equity and access are worsening.\n\nAt
              Coursedog, we believe Higher Ed's reliance on outdated software is the root of the problem. 75% of
              universities operate entirely on legacy, on-premise software, resulting in millions of frustrated students
              saddled with heaps of debt.\n\nCoursedog's mission is to break down barriers in Higher Education. To do
              so, we are building a modern operating system for Higher Education: from supercharging the student
              scheduling experience to empowering administrators with analytics that graduate more students in less
              time. Our vision is to build software that enables the $800b Higher Education market to reach its highest
              ideals to facilitate upward mobility, equity and positive change.\n\nCoursedog has raised $23m in venture
              capital as a hypergrowth startup backed by YC, First Round Capital and has tripled its employee headcount
              over the last 1.5 years. We were recently ranked in Forbes top 500 US startup employers and our employee
              engagement scores rank in the top 5% of tech companies. You can learn more about our culture
              [here](https://coursedog1.notion.site/The-Coursedog-Brain-e49387c1986b46c8ae72d6b98b89adcf).\n\nWe are
              looking for a Backend Node.JS Engineer to join the Coursedog engineering team. The ideal candidate will be
              a proven technologist, passionate about software engineering, and have deep technical understanding of
              technologies such as Node.js. The position will be responsible for our backend services, infrastructure,
              and databases, and is also likely to touch the frontend quite a bit as well.\n\nAs a company, we value
              diversity and inclusion. We encourage people from underrepresented groups to apply.\n\n**What You Will
              Do:**\n* Use Node.js, MongoDB, and other BE tools to design and implement the underlying application logic
              and database structure powering our APIs.\n* Improving our AWS infrastructure and overall application
              performance\n* Work closely with other developers and infrastructure engineers to analyze and design the
              application architecture, and implement the functional requirements.\n* Understand the needs of our
              clients to develop and improve the end-user experience.\n* Collaborate with product managers to develop
              and enhance our products according to our product roadmap and business strategy\n\n**About You:**\n*
              Naturally curious and willing to step into the user‚Äôs shoes\n* 5+ years of backend development
              experience\n* Full professional proficiency in English\n* Deep technical knowledge and expertise in BE
              technologies and tools (Node.js, Express, MongoDB)\n* Demonstrated experience with designing REST APIs\n*
              Familiar with building SPAs and using Git for version control\n* Experience with building complicated,
              enterprise-level systems\n* Experience with unit and e2e testing\n* Owners mentality\n* Comfortable with
              working in a fully remote team\n\n**Bonus Points for Any of These Skills:**\n* 5+ years of development
              experience for web applications, especially in b2b saas\n* BS/MS in Computer Science or related field\n*

              with frontend frameworks such as Vue.JS\n\n**Coursedog Provides:**\n* Flexible work hours - we have no

              you prefer.\n* Expectations of time off - we push all team members to take off at least 17 days per year.

              popular Git extensions for VS Code - like GitLens. VS Code UI will be open sourced and will become part of
              your public profile! If you have experience with dev tools like GitHub, UI plugins for Git, etc., you
